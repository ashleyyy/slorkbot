# slorkbot

I've put together a little outgoing webhook that is hosted on Heroku with a postgres database. From my team's slack, we can talk to slorkbot, who will respond with compliments. The compliments are added by the team members. 

It's pretty great. I'm working on expanding it to a full slack integration.
